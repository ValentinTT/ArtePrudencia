# ArtePrudencia
ArtePrudencia is a sort of daily reminder of quotes from the book "El arte de la prudencia". The idea is to recive each day only a quote so you can think about it and get full benefit of it.
It's a personal project of a teenager who is learning android so it won't be develop as fast as I'd like, but I'll try do my best ;)
